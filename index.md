I'm a Senior Computational Biologist in the Satija Lab at the New York Genome Center. 

I did my PhD studies in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University advised by Mike Schatz and Ben Langmead. I contributed to many projects in computational genomics, including those on my Publications page.
